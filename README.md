# hello-world

I enjoy playing the piano, ice-skating, computer gaming, yoga, dancing, and coding. 
My life is pretty full with graduate studies and research right now, but someday I want to travel and explore the world!

What comes around goes around, so be good to others and try to make everyone's life a little bit better!

Now, lets get coding.
